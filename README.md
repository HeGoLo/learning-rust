## Learning Rust
The sole purpose of this project is to learn the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

### Compiling
The source code can be found in [src](./src) and currently programs are compiled manually (until I learn a build tool for Rust that is).

    rustc --test --out-dir=bin src/insertion.rs

### Running tests
To run a test you have to have compiled using the ```--test``` flag.

    rust.c bin/insertion
